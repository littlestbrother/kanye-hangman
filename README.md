# what would yeezus do?

A [svelte](https://svelte.dev/) web-application that uses obfuscated quotes from [kanye.rest](http://kanye.rest) in a hangman-like game. At first the entire quote is obfuscated, but the user can guess letters to slowly de-obfuscate the quote. The entire quote will never be revealed, instead- the user must finish the game by guessing the entire quote.

You can run this app by cloning the repo, installing dependencies, starting the development server, and navigating to `localhost:5173`

`git clone https://github.com/littlestbrother/wwyd && cd wwyd && yarn && yarn dev`
